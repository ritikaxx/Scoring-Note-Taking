    <p>Using NLP models like BERT, ALBERTA, DEBERTA, ROBERTA we will be showing the result of the input given by the trained physicians to analyze the patient notes for all the candidates.</p>

        <h4>Automation</h4>
        <p>Automate the manual task of trained physicians to analyze all the candidates notes to correctly map the features or diseases with the patients symptoms, problems and medical history using NLP models.</p>

        <h4>Handling Ambiguity</h4>
        <p>Statements like “quitting job” and  “no longer interested on working ” referring to the same feature/ problem have to be mapped correctly according to the exam rubrics</p>

        <h4>Web Application</h4>
        <p>A full software solution in which the input will be in the form of a csv file uploaded by the trained physicians and the output will be the mapped feature and the particular locations of the part of the notes implying the annotations for scoring the candidates.</p>

    <p>We propose a methodology for National Board of Medical Examiner, which accesses the skills of writing patient’s notes for Medical Licensing Examination. The process of assessing the notes for every candidate manually is very time consuming for the trained physicians.
      <br>  Using NLP, the task of identifying clinical concepts in patient’s notes following the exam rubric will be done.
      Using NLP models like BERT, ALBERTA, DEBERTA, ROBERTA we will be showing the result of the input given by the trained physicians to analyze the patient notes for all the candidates</p>
