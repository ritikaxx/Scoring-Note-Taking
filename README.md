# Scoring-Note-Taking
Scoring patient note taking by doctors using NLP.


With the advancements in Natural Language Processing, the manual job of a physician to analyze every patient’s notes thoroughly to ensure a proper diagnosis of the symptoms, complaints of the patients, and their medical history can be improved. So, we propose a methodology for National Board of Medical Examiner, which accesses the skills of writing patient’s notes for Medical Licensing Examination. The process of assessing the notes for every candidate manually is very time consuming for the trained physicians. Using NLP, the task of identifying clinical concepts in patient’s notes following the exam rubric will be done.
Using NLP models like BERT, ALBERTA, DEBERTA, ROBERTA we will be showing the result of the input given by the trained physicians to analyze the patient notes for all the candidates.
